# Stic'K

## Project Description

Stic'K is a simple and colorful note-taking app designed to streamline task management for a K-beauty supply company. With a virtual sticky wall, it enables users to create personalized to-do lists for each buyer, add, edit, and delete tasks, and efficiently manage a customized pipeline in one display.

The app also serves as a general, user-friendly, and colorful note-taking tool that can be used by anyone, just like a virtual sticky note wall.
